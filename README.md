# WikiScribbler
*Create wikis like you do websites!*

## What is it?
WikiScribbler is made as a template, where you use *WikiScriber* to write the code for it,
it is designed for massive wikis, and follows my big rule, ***NO ADS***.

### Why no ads?
I hate ads, I think you do too, and I want to put UX over money, here is a graph to show you:
```
-- MAX PRIORITY: UX
-
-
-
-- MID PRIORITY: UI
-
-
-
-- MIN PRIORITY: MONEY
```
